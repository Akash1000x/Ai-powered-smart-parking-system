AI-Powered Parking Management System:

This project is an AI-based parking management system designed to automate the process of vehicle entry, parking, and exit. The system uses number plate recognition and a web interface to streamline parking operations, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience.

Features:
Number Plate Recognition: Automatically scans vehicle license plates at the entry and exit gates.
Seamless Entry: The gate opens automatically once the vehicle's license plate is recognized.
Web-Based Payment System: Users can input their vehicle details, scan a QR code, and submit payments directly through the website.

Exit Process: 
Once the payment is confirmed, the exit gate opens automatically after scanning the number plate.
Reminders for Unpaid Users: If payment is not made, a reminder is sent before the vehicle can exit.

Real-Time Alerts: Users receive an on-screen alert confirming the successful payment and allowing exit.

Technologies Used:
Frontend & Backend: Next.js for both frontend and backend development.
AI for License Plate Recognition: Utilizing OpenCV and a machine learning model to extract vehicle license plate information.

Payment Integration: Integrated with a payment gateway to handle transactions securely.

QR Code Scanning: Used to identify parked vehicles and initiate the payment process.


Project Structure:
pages/: Contains Next.js pages for user interaction and payment processing.
components/: Reusable UI components.
public/: Public assets like images and styles.
backend/: Custom API routes and server-side functionality for handling payments, license plate scanning, and more.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/parking-management-system.git
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install

Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file and add your API keys and other environment-specific variables.

How It Works

Vehicle Arrival: The system scans the number plate when a vehicle arrives, opening the entry gate if the scan is successful.

User Actions:
Users park their vehicles and scan a QR code displayed at the parking spot.
The QR code opens the parking management website, where users input their vehicle details and make payments.

Exit: At the exit, the system scans the number plate again. If payment has been made, the gate opens automatically. If not, a reminder is shown, and payment is required before exiting.

Payment Processing
The web app includes a payment gateway integration that allows users to pay for parking directly via the website. Once the payment is processed, users will receive a confirmation alert, and the system will allow them to exit.
